# AngularApp
Basic application with routes , data transfer between pages using services and using fire base and angular fire for save update and store the data in realtime perspective

Prerequisitives 

1) Node installed

# Firebase:

Mainly provides centralized database service helps in save store and update data in realtime directly from the browser

Eg: Open the same application in firefox and chrome and edit in one browser its get updated in the other
In perspective with firebase when you change it save stores and update(emits the event) which is continously listening by the application to update it.

This is also usefull when we have multiple application which only listens to centralized database anytime update in the database the app gets updated.
